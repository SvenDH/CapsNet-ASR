# CapsNet-ASR
Phoneme recognition with Capsule Networks


Extra ideas (possible individual research questions)
-since our frames are not necessarily of only one phone, we can maybe label them as 0.75A 0.25B and compare this with the classifier distribution.
This would mean that (0.75A 0.25B) predicted as (0.6A 0.2B 0.2C) is better than (0.6A 0.1B 0.3C), even though in both predictions the amount of prediciton for A is the same.
